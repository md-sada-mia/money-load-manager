# money_load_manager

Build a 100% offline Android app for mobile financial service agents that automatically tracks daily transactions by reading incoming SMS in real time. The app will detect flexiload, bKash, and utility bill transactions without manual data entry, store all data locally, and provide clear day-end summaries. A built-in Training Manager will allow new SMS formats to be taught once, enabling accurate, private, and cost-free operation with no servers, no internet, and no paid AI.
